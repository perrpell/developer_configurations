The emacs director of the development_configurations rep is for configuration related to developing with the emacs editor.  Specifically the emacs file binds the ruby-mode.el file to all *.rb files.

The ruby-mode.el file was downloaded from:
https://github.com/djwhitt/ruby-mode


It goes in /usr/share/emacs/22.1/lisp/ and must be copied in under sudo.
